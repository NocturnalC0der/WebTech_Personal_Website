        <h1>Developer - Balance Estimation and Analysis Model</h1>
        <p>
          Working with a Slovak company in the energy sector, which builds and
          runs battery parks for electrical energy (https://greenbat.sk/).
          Developing a program using machine learning algorithms, that collects
          and stores data on the power grid, and makes real-time predictions
          about its state in 15-minute intervals. The project is nearing
          completion and has great potential to increase the effectiveness of
          the company and its profit.

        <h1>Content Creator - Beginner Rubik's Cube Course</h1>
        <p>
          Working on an extensive, online video course, teaching the basics
          principles and a solving method for the classic Rubik’s Cube.
          Developed a unique learning experience, where the student can follow
          along with me, their cube being identically shuffled as mine
          throughout the entire course. Total lecture count of 63, 50 lessons of
          learning material - theory and practice, 13 of history and
          preparation. Tested the method succesfully in person on different age
          groups. This project consumed a lot of my time, and unfortunately, I
          didn't finish it. I think it was a combination of me losing interest
          in the topic itself, being a perfectionist, and it being too hard for
          me at the time. But I may come back to it someday.

        <h1>Self-Learning Coding</h1>
        <p>
          I started learning to code on my own at age 12, because I wanted to
          become a hacker. I found the online coding teacher Mosh, from whom my
          parents bought me a python course. Later I also took a JS course on
          Udemy that I got for christmans from my uncle, but didn't finish it
          all and forgot most of it. My coding journey was bumpy, on and off.
          About a two years ago I chose informatics as my high school graduation
          subject, and was back to coding.
