          <h1>Strength Training</h1>
          <p>
            Fitness has been a passion of mine for 7 years. Building a healthy,
            strong and aesthetic body is a noble pursuit in my eyes, and
            everyone should be involved in it to some degree. I started with
            just bodyweight exercises, eventually incorporated external weights
            as well, making me a well-rounded strength athlete.

            The first books I remember really reading were the Harry Potter
            series. Our grandparents had the Slovak version, and at home, we had
            the English versions. From age 10 to age 16, I read the whole
            trilogy a total of 5 times, twice in Slovak, and three times in
            English. I think I will reread it in the future someday. Today, I
            like ready factual, self-help books, that expose me to great ideas
            mainly in the realms of business and health.

          <h1>Nutrition</h1>
          <p>
            I take my food quite seriously. When I started my fitness journey in
            2018, I made a rule to myself that I'm not going to eat processed
            food, or sweets. That was the first rule that I followed in terms of
            nutrition. With time, along with my brother, who is now a lot better
            at cooking than me, I learned to prepare basic meals for myself, and
            became more interested in the topic of healthy nutrition, and how
            our food choices also relate to our environment.
